## Food Donation Management System

A web application which is useful for management of food donation and collection activities.  

## Introduction:

-- In our commitment to addressing the pervasive issue of food insecurity, we propose the development of a Food Donation Management System. This system aims to streamline and optimize the process of food donation, ensuring efficient collection, distribution, and tracking of donated food items. With the increasing global concern about hunger and food wastage, this project seeks to bridge the gap between surplus food providers and those in need.


## Objectives:

### User-Friendly Interface:
Develop an intuitive platform that allows donors to easily input information about surplus food items.
Ensure a straightforward process for recipient organizations to express their needs.

### Efficient Coordination:
Implement a basic scheduling system for donors to coordinate food pickups with recipient organizations.
Prioritize simplicity to encourage the involvement of a wide range of users.

### Reducing Food Wastage:
Implement an intelligent algorithm to match surplus food with the most relevant recipient organizations based on their needs and capacity.
Utilize notifications and alerts to ensure timely consumption of perishable items.

### Community Engagement:
Incorporate a feature that encourages community involvement by allowing individuals to volunteer for food distribution events.
Enable donors to receive feedback on the impact of their contributions, fostering a sense of community and social responsibility.

 ### -- Conclusion:
This Food Donation Management System combines a user-friendly interface with a robust backend, utilizing Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf. By incorporating dynamic form handling, database storage, and easy navigation, the system aims to facilitate seamless interactions for users interested in contributing to the cause of reducing food waste and addressing food insecurity.
