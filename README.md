📅 Prioritize simplicity to encourage the involvement of a wide range of users.

### Reducing Food Wastage:
🌐 Implement an intelligent algorithm to match surplus food with the most relevant recipient organizations.
🌐 Utilize notifications and alerts to ensure timely consumption of perishable items.

### Community Engagement:
🤝 Incorporate a feature for community involvement, allowing individuals to volunteer for food distribution events.
🤝 Enable donors to receive feedback on the impact of their contributions, fostering a sense of community and social responsibility.

### Technological Stack:
Technological Stack:
